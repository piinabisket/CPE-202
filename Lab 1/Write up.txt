The iterative function will return the number after a second, but the recursive
function crashes before it can get there. Python limits recursion to 997 to
prevent stack overflow, and to reach 1000! the program needs to recurse more than 
996 times. Stack overflow occurs when too many items are written to the same stack,
which can cause the code to break down, so Python artificially limits the amount
of possible recursions to prevent this.
